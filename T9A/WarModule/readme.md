Vorschlag:

If your General fought in at least one Battle and survived the Game, roll on the following table:

| Roll 2D6 for column and row | 1-5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | +1 Off       | Battle Finesse |
| 2   | +1 Def       | Battle Hardened |
| 3  | +1 Agi       | Feared by Reputation
| 4   | +1 Dis       | Loot! |
| 5  | -1 AS       | Deadeye |
| 6 |   +4" inspiring presence    | Chosen General |

**Battle Finesse**: the general advances in battle skills - the general gains +1 Offense and +1 Discipline (one battle).

**Battle Hardened**: the general gains understanding in taking blows in a less harmful manner - the general gains +1 Resilience (permanently).

**Feared by Reputation**: the general’s actions precede him - Enemy unit’s within 6” of the general have -1 Discipline

**Untouchable**: Aegis (6+), Distracting, Cannot be stomped oder +1 Def 
> Ein gegenvorschlag zum Loot: Irgendwas defensives. Sonst gibt es hier nur Battle Hardened (Sick by the way!).

**Bloodthirsty**: the general is on a killing spree and wants to get into the action ASAP - your general gains Devastating Charge (+ 1 Adv).

> Ein gegenvorschlag zu der Knarre: Devastating Charge. Das charmante an dieser Ability ist, dass man in die Klammer schreiben darf was man will. +1 Movement beim Chargen ist gut, aber jetzt auch nicht super geil. Ich würder ungern etwas wie +1 Strength oder Poison attacks oder etwas ähnlich krasses nehmen. Hast du eine andere Ability die ähnlich gut, aber nicht broken ist? Ist natürlich dann wieder gemein für Generäle, die nicht in den Nahkampf wollen. Wobei mir nur Caster einfallen an der Stelle. Für unsere Kampagne erstmal egal. Aber wenn jemand Elfen oder Lizards spielen will, muss man hier vermutlich nochmal ran.

**Chosen General**: the general gains undivided respect from his army - your general gains + 1D6” of range for Inspiring Presence (permanently). 

## Offene Fragen:

- Welche Szenarios? 
 - Welche Secondary Objectives?

Am liebsten hätte ich hier einen W12 um ehrlich zu sein. Dann noch die Frage, 1 Secondary oder 2 pro Match? Wahrscheinlich mal mit einem anfangen und dann kann man ja nach der Kampagne evaluieren, ob 2 vielleicht witziger wären.

| Roll a D12 | Secondary Objective | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Assassination |
| 2 | Invitation |
| 3 | Flags |
| 4 | Target enemy |
| 5 | Breach! |
| 6 | Flood! |
| 7 | The Rite |
| 8 | Secure Quarter |
| 9 | Battlefield Dance |
| 10 |  |
| 11 |  |
| 12 |  |

**Assassination**: killing an enemy leader will break their spirit - write down one of your enemies characters on a card and place if face down next to the board. If you kill that character, you gain 500 points extra. If it survives, your opponent gains 250 points

**Invitation**: redirecting the enemy to a favorable place on the battlefield requires great skill - write down an enemy, none-warmachine unit on a card and write down a quarter of the table (topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright). Place the card face down next to the board. If the designated unit ends in the designated table quarter at the end of the game, or just before the unit dies of flee’s of the table, you gain half the unit’s value in victory point.

**Flags**: retrieving valuable items in the midst of battle put’s your forces at risk; is it worth it?  - place 2 flags each (Stargrave style). If a unit ends its movement phase on a flag, you receive 200 pts. A flag can only grant victory points once. 

**Target enemy**: defeating an infamous enemy unit can change the tide of a campaign  - mark an enemy unit after deployment. If you kill this unit you gain double its victory points. 

**Breach!**: when all that matter is reaching the enemies grounds - Player A: for each unit that enters the enemy deployment zone, you gain 200 pts. A unit can only gain victory points by doing so once. Player B: for each unit your enemy can not get into your deployment zone, you gain 200 pts

**Flood!**: when there is a graver danger then enemy forces closing in on you -  open objective - For each of your units that are on a hill or in a house at the end of the game, you gain 700 pts

**The Rite**: sometimes the gods demand terrible sacrifices, to serve the higher purpose- hidden objective - if you lose over 90% of your army (in pts) during the game, you gain 40% of the point costs of each of your own units that were killed. 

**Secure Quarter**: defend a sector of the table at all costs - open objective, for both sides - roll to designate the defending player. The defending player chooses a table quarter. He needs to prevent enemy troops from entering this quarter. The defending players starts with 750 secondary victory pts. The attacking player receives 125 pts per turn for each unit in the designated zone. 

**Battlefield Dance**: victory to the most mobile unit of the game - open objective - each player designates one of his unit’s. That unit gains 200 pts for every time it ends it’s movement phase on / in a terrain element. The unit must be in/on the terrein element with over 50% of it’s footprint. Each terrain element can only provide points once, but can provide the points to both players designated unit’s.
