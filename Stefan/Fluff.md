He startled awake. Dazed and confused. Was that a vision? Nightmare? Delusion? These days those were hard to differentiate.
It was as if the fabric of reality became more brittle by the hour. And something else entierly was taking its place.
The message was clear though nevertheless. Hundreds of souls were ready for reaping in the City of the Damned. And so He turned east.

## The Warband
One does not simply walk into Mordheim. That much was clear even to the corroding mind of the wanderer. He needed company.
On his way east lay a monastery of the Sisterhood of Sigmar. Warrior women, as devout in their belief as fierce to defend it by sword. These would do!
