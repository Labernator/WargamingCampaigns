Determine turn order at the start of the game 

Alternative: at the start of each round 

The turn sequence itself does not change:
1 movement
2 Shooting
3 Magic
4 combat

But instead of activating all warriors, the active player first activates only his leader.
The leader ability gains the addendum:
When activating the leader, you may also activate 3 other miniatures of your warband within 6".
They follow the same sequence as your leader but cannot be activated again in the same turn.
The leader completes the turn sequence.

After the leader activation, all other players in the turn order may activate their leaders.

Once all leaders have made their turn, the players may activate the rest of their warband members again in turn order.
