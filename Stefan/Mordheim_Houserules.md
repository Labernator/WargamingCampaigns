Henchmen are only here for the rations  
Henchmen do not gain experience. After 3 scenarios you may choose one non-large, non-animal henchman to be promoted. If for any reason, you don't have 6 heroes after game 5, another non-large, non-animal henchman is promoted.

The Hero Save  
After rolling all the injuries of your warband, and contemplating the total annihilation that would soon follow, the player may decide to call upon the Hero Save.\nIn doing so, the player decides to ignore all the injuries to all the models in the warband, but also renounces to all the experience gains of the game. All other post battle sequence steps take place as normal.\nNote: The exploration can therefore be made by all the heroes in the warband, as none was removed from the game.
