### Issue
In den AlbionCampaignRules wird auf S.9 Recruitment & Trading beschrieben.  
Dort wird geregelt, dass das Albion Trading Chart statt dem normalen Mordheim Chart verwendet wird.  
Dieses Trading Chart ist jedoch nicht auffindbar. Ein [Reddit Aufruf](https://www.reddit.com/r/mordheim/comments/10q5dpk/albion_campaign_trading_chart) hat zu nichts geführt.  
Darauf habe ich den broheim Betreiber ntdars angeschrieben.  

**Ich**  
> Hi there,  
> your site is an amazing source of material for this wonderful game. Thanks a ton for maintaining it!

> I plan to start an Albion campaign and try to find all the resources for it. I found one dramatis personae that if attached.
> 
> Sadly the old mordheimer website is down and I couldn't find a backup.

> Do you by any chance have the Albion Trading Chart. I feel like that would really benefit the campaign.

**Ich**  
> Hi,

**ntdars**  
> That makes sense - yeah it's not on the Mordheimer site, in the

**Ich**  
> Thanks for checking!
> Take Care

### Proposed solution
Da das Chart entweder nie existiert hat oder aber gründlich verschollen ist schlage ich vor einfach die Reelun aus der Sylvania Kampagne zu übernehmen um die Ressourcenknappheit abzubilden:  

> As such, warbands who do not possess a model with the Street Wise ability are forced to add +2 to the rarity of all items they seek. Once the Street Wise skill is attained, the rarity roll will return to normal.
